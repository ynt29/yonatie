      <div class="paragraph">

          My experience in frontend development has equipped me with creating
          user-friendly interfaces, the result of user-oriented analytics and
          attention to detail.
          <br />
          I intend to use my coding skills and problem-solving abilities to
          extract and transform meaningful insights from datasets into
          actionable plans.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Outside of work, I’ve utilized data analytics skills such as
          spreadsheets and data visualization for personal financial planning.
          This includes tracking transactions, categorizing spending and finding
          important expense insights to identify expense category for potential
          cutbacks.
          <br />
          Data-Driven Decision Making has helped me plan spending precisely and
          align it with real-life needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe that determination for learning new things and adapting to
          new challenges are traits that have shaped me into who I am today.
          <br />
          I graduated from Political Science at Ramkhamhaeng University in 2020,
          which has nothing to do with programming at all. However, my
          commitment to learning unfamiliar things like frontend development and
          not giving up even when it’s difficult has led to success in embarking
          on this journey. and I confident that these qualities will enable me
          to excel in the field of data analytics.
